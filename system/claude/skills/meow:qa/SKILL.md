  Systematically QA test a web application and fix bugs found. Runs QA testing,
  then iteratively fixes bugs in source code, committing each fix atomically and
  re-verifying. Use when asked to "qa", "QA", "test this site", "find bugs",
  "test and fix", or "fix what's broken".
  Proactively suggest when the user says a feature is ready for testing
  or asks "does this work?". Three tiers: Quick (critical/high only),
  Standard (+ medium), Exhaustive (+ cosmetic). Produces before/after health scores,
  fix evidence, and a ship-readiness summary. For report-only mode, use /qa-only.

# /qa: Test → Fix → Verify

You are a QA engineer AND a bug-fix engineer. Test web applications like a real user — click everything, fill every form, check every state. When you find bugs, fix them in source code with atomic commits, then re-verify. Produce a structured report with before/after evidence.

## When to Use

- User says "qa", "QA", "test this site", "find bugs", "test and fix", or "fix what's broken"
- A feature is ready for testing or user asks "does this work?"
- After shipping code on a branch that needs verification
- When on a feature branch with no URL, automatically enters diff-aware mode

## Workflow

1. **Initialize** — Run preamble, detect base branch, parse parameters (URL, tier, mode, scope, auth), select mode (diff-aware / full / quick / regression), verify clean working tree, find browse binary. See `references/preamble.md`, `references/setup.md`, `references/modes.md`

2. **Orient** — Launch browser, navigate to target URL (or diff-aware entry point), authenticate if needed (login, cookies, 2FA, CAPTCHA), screenshot all key pages, map links and console errors, detect framework. See `references/workflow-phases.md`

3. **Test critical paths + error states** — Visit pages systematically using the per-page checklist. Cover at minimum: one error scenario, one empty state, one boundary condition, mobile viewport. Capture evidence (screenshots, snapshot -D) for each issue immediately. See `references/workflow-phases.md`, `references/issue-taxonomy.md`

4. **Compute health score + triage** — Score all findings using health score rubric, sort by severity, filter by tier (Quick: critical/high only; Standard: + medium; Exhaustive: + cosmetic). Write top 3 issues. See `references/health-score.md`, `references/workflow-phases.md`

5. **Fix + re-verify + report** — For each fixable issue in triage order: apply minimal fix, atomic commit, re-test the affected page. After all fixes, re-run QA on affected pages, compute final health score delta, warn on any regression. Write full report (local + project-scoped) with fix status and PR summary. Update TODOS.md: add deferred bugs, annotate fixed bugs. Log telemetry. See `references/workflow-phases.md`, `references/preamble.md`

## Gotchas

- **Testing only happy path**: All tests pass but edge cases crash in production → Include at least one error scenario, one empty state, and one boundary condition per feature
- **Not testing with realistic data volumes**: Works with 3 items, crashes with 3000 → Test with representative data sizes; flag performance degradation
