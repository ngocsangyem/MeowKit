# Distribution Pipeline Check (Step 1.5)

If the diff introduces a new standalone artifact (CLI binary, library package, tool) — not a web
service with existing deployment — verify that a distribution pipeline exists.

1. Check if the diff adds a new `cmd/` directory, `main.go`, or `bin/` entry point:
   ```bash
   git diff origin/<base> --name-only | grep -E '(cmd/.*/main\.go|bin/|Cargo\.toml|setup\.py|package\.json)' | head -5
   ```

2. If new artifact detected, check for a release workflow:
   ```bash
   ls .github/workflows/ 2>/dev/null | grep -iE 'release|publish|dist'
   ```

3. **If no release pipeline exists and a new artifact was added:** Use AskUserQuestion:
   - "This PR adds a new binary/tool but there's no CI/CD pipeline to build and publish it.
     Users won't be able to download the artifact after merge."
   - A) Add a release workflow now (GitHub Actions cross-platform build + GitHub Releases)
   - B) Defer — add to TODOS.md
   - C) Not needed — this is internal/web-only, existing deployment covers it

4. **If release pipeline exists:** Continue silently.
5. **If no new artifact detected:** Skip silently.
