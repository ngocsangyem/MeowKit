# mk:ask-me

## Overview

Answer questions about the current project — codebase, architecture, conventions,
workflows, rationale, constraints — with minimal cited `file:line` evidence.
Gives the agent deep, fast project understanding instead of long grep/search
sessions. Read-only by default; the answer is the deliverable.

## Route first

Classify the request before gathering evidence. If a specialist owns it, name that skill and stop;
do not partially answer. The complete routing table is
[references/specialist-routes.md](references/specialist-routes.md).

This skill answers what is true, how it works here, why it exists, and what constraints apply —
about the current project only.

## When to Use

**Auto-activate on:**
- "how does X work *here* / in this project / in this repo"
- "what does X mean" (project file, config, convention)
- "why is X structured this way"
- "is it true that ... in this repo" (claim-check)
- "what constraints apply before touching X"
- "explain X with sources / citations"

**Explicit:** `the ask-me skill [question] [--depth quick|standard|deep] [--save-to <path>]`

**Do NOT invoke when:** the request matches any Redirect First row, asks to
change code, or is a pure general-knowledge question (answer those directly,
no scouting).

## Process

1. **Route check.** Match against Redirect First. Owned elsewhere → name the
   skill, stop.
2. **Parse.** Extract the question. Infer kind: factual, explanation, rationale,
   constraint-summary, or claim-check. Depth: `standard` unless flagged.
3. **Minimal evidence plan.** Prefer user-provided paths; else grep targeted
   keywords. Docs/project context first, then targeted code/config. Apply the
   forbidden-path list below.
4. **Bounded gather.** Read only relevant slices within the depth budget. Stop
   as soon as the answer is sufficiently supported. Track `path:line` for every
   source-backed claim.
5. **Synthesize.** Direct answer first; separate verified claims from inference;
   state confidence (high/medium/low — mandatory); list limitations; mention a
   related specialist skill only if the user's next likely action leaves scope.
6. **Optional save.** Only via `--save-to` or explicit request, per the
   save-path policy below. On unsafe path or conflict, refuse the write and
   return the answer inline.

Depth budgets and output/failure contracts: [references/answer-contract.md](references/answer-contract.md).

### Forbidden Paths (never read)

`.env*`, secrets/keys/credentials/tokens of any kind, `.meowkit/memory/`,
`session-state/`, dependency dirs (`node_modules/`, `.venv/`), build outputs,
browser profiles. No WebSearch — current-docs lookup belongs to `mk:docs-finder`.

### Save-Path Policy

Write only when asked, and only under: an explicit user path inside the project
root, `tasks/reports/`, or `${PLUGIN_DATA}/ask-me/`. Path escapes a safe
root → refuse and answer inline. Target exists → ask before overwrite or use a
timestamped name.

## Answer contract

Return a direct answer, confidence, cited evidence, and only needed inference/limitations. Include
one related specialist only when the likely next action leaves this scope. Load
[references/answer-contract.md](references/answer-contract.md) for the exact template and failure
handling.

## Workflow Integration

**On-demand** — no single phase anchor; usable at any point from Phase 0
(orient) through Phase 6 (reflect). Does not gate or feed any phase artifact.

## Handoff Protocol

The answer is terminal by default — no agent receives it. If the user's next
action leaves this skill's scope, point to the single owning specialist skill
(one pointer, never auto-invoke it).

## Gotchas

- Don't turn an answer request into a plan — the answer IS the deliverable.
- Don't over-scout: stop at sufficiency, not at budget exhaustion.
- Don't answer option-selection questions; route them (`mk:party` / `mk:brainstorming`).
- Never cite project facts without `path:line` sources; unsourced points go
  under Inference.
- Missing docs lower confidence but don't block — fall back to targeted
  code/config reads.
- "How does [library] work" is `mk:docs-finder` territory; this skill only
  answers "how does X work *in this project*".
