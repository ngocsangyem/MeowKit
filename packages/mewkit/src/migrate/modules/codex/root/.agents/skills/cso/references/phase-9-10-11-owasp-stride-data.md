# Phase 9: OWASP Top 10 Assessment

For each OWASP category, perform targeted analysis. Use the Grep tool for all searches — scope file extensions to detected stacks from Phase 0.

## A01: Broken Access Control
- Check for missing auth on controllers/routes (skip_before_action, skip_authorization, public, no_auth)
- Check for direct object reference patterns (params[:id], req.params.id, request.args.get)
- Can user A access user B's resources by changing IDs?
- Is there horizontal/vertical privilege escalation?

## A02: Cryptographic Failures
- Weak crypto (MD5, SHA1, DES, ECB) or hardcoded secrets
- Is sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit?
- Are keys/secrets properly managed (env vars, not hardcoded)?

## A03: Injection
- SQL injection: raw queries, string interpolation in SQL
- Command injection: system(), exec(), spawn(), popen
- Template injection: render with params, eval(), html_safe, raw()
- LLM prompt injection: see Phase 7 for comprehensive coverage

## A04: Insecure Design
- Rate limits on authentication endpoints?
- Account lockout after failed attempts?
- Business logic validated server-side?

## A05: Security Misconfiguration
- CORS configuration (wildcard origins in production?)
- CSP headers present?
- Debug mode / verbose errors in production?

## A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components
See **Phase 3 (Dependency Supply Chain)** for comprehensive component analysis.

## A07: Identification and Authentication Failures
- Session management: creation, storage, invalidation
- Password policy: complexity, rotation, breach checking
- MFA: available? enforced for admin?
- Token management: JWT expiration, refresh rotation

## A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures
See **Phase 4 (CI/CD Pipeline Security)** for pipeline protection analysis.
- Deserialization inputs validated?
- Integrity checking on external data?

## A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
- Authentication events logged?
- Authorization failures logged?
- Admin actions audit-trailed?
- Logs protected from tampering?

## A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- URL construction from user input?
- Internal service reachability from user-controlled URLs?
- Allowlist/blocklist enforcement on outbound requests?

# Phase 10: STRIDE Threat Model

For each major component identified in Phase 0, evaluate:

```
COMPONENT: [Name]
  Spoofing:             Can an attacker impersonate a user/service?
  Tampering:            Can data be modified in transit/at rest?
  Repudiation:          Can actions be denied? Is there an audit trail?
  Information Disclosure: Can sensitive data leak?
  Denial of Service:    Can the component be overwhelmed?
  Elevation of Privilege: Can a user gain unauthorized access?
```

# Phase 11: Data Classification

Classify all data handled by the application:

```
DATA CLASSIFICATION
═══════════════════
RESTRICTED (breach = legal liability):
  - Passwords/credentials: [where stored, how protected]
  - Payment data: [where stored, PCI compliance status]
  - PII: [what types, where stored, retention policy]

CONFIDENTIAL (breach = business damage):
  - API keys: [where stored, rotation policy]
  - Business logic: [trade secrets in code?]
  - User behavior data: [analytics, tracking]

INTERNAL (breach = embarrassment):
  - System logs: [what they contain, who can access]
  - Configuration: [what's exposed in error messages]

PUBLIC:
  - Marketing content, documentation, public APIs
```
