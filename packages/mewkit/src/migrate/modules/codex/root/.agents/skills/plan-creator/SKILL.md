name: "plan-creator"
description: "Creates structured multi-file implementation plans before build. Scope-aware: trivial tasks exit early, simple tasks get fast plans, complex tasks get full research + phase files + validation. Enforces Gate 1. Activated by the plan skill or the cook skill. NOT for ticket complexity analysis against an existing codebase (see mk:planning-engine); NOT for CEO-level scope review of existing plans (see mk:plan-ceo-review)."

# Plan Creator

Public surface: classify → inspect → capture missing decisions → draft → validate → Gate 1. Produces plan.md overview + phase-XX detail files; execution, existing-plan audits, visual rendering, archive, and durable-memory capture stay with their existing owners.

## When to Use

Activate when:

- User runs `the plan skill [task]` or `the cook skill [task]`
- Non-trivial task (> 2 files OR > 1h OR architectural decisions)
- User supplies ≥2 upstream reports/specs (office-hours, brainstorming, planning-engine, confluence-spec, intake output…) → step-00.5 consolidates them into a Plan Intake Packet before planning (see `references/plan-intake-packet.md`)
- User supplies a design evidence packet (e.g. from `mk:figma`) → plan consumes it (viewport/state ACs, critical-action validation matrix, phase `blocked_on:` for high-risk flow ambiguity), never re-analyzes the design source (see `references/design-evidence-consumption.md`)
- Gate 1 requires a plan before Phase 3
- Green-field product build ("build a kanban app", "create a SaaS dashboard", "make a retro game maker") → step-00 auto-detects and offers `--product-level`
- Existing-plan audit → `mk:validate-plan`; archive → lifecycle CLI; visual rendering → `mk:visual-plan`.
- Hard/deep plan creation still runs its built-in red-team and validation interview before Gate 1. These are design-quality gates, not standalone subcommands, and must never be routed away.
- Compatibility aliases: `the plan skill archive` → [archive workflow](references/archive-workflow.md); `the plan skill red-team {path}` → [standalone red-team workflow](references/red-team-standalone.md); `the plan skill validate {path}` → [standalone validation workflow](references/validate-standalone.md).

Standalone aliases route to their compatibility references; they do not replace hard/deep red-team or validation. `--html` routes to `mk:visual-plan`.

Skip when:

- `the fix skill` with complexity=simple (Gate 1 exception)
- `mk:scale-routing` returns workflow=one-shot + zero blast radius

**`--spike` constraints (Agile context only — gated by `agile-feedback-cycle.md` 2 when loaded):**

- Requires `--timebox <duration>` (e.g., `--timebox 2d`, `--timebox 4h`); reject with "spike requires --timebox" if absent
- Sets plan frontmatter `spike: true`, `timebox:`, and `findings_doc:` (default `tasks/plans/{slug}/findings.md`)
- INCOMPATIBLE with `--product-level` and `mk:autobuild` FULL density (autobuild gate breaks). Reject combination "spike incompatible with autobuild FULL — use --fast or mk:cook"
- Advisory cap: warn if `story_points > 5` — likely two spikes, or spike + story

**Composable flags:**

- `--tdd` — add tests-first phase sections and preserve strict TDD in the cook handoff. See `references/tdd-mode.md`.
- Visual work belongs to `mk:visual-plan`. Plan-creator emits only the handoff metadata needed for that skill; Markdown plan files remain source of truth.

## Requirements Capture Contract

Before producing a plan, plan-creator MUST be able to answer all 5 dimensions in concrete sentences (cook's exact-requirements contract — see `.agents/skills/cook/SKILL.md` "Exact-Requirements Contract (Phase 1)"):

1. **Expected output** — concrete artifact(s) the user will see at the end (file paths, feature behavior, UI screen, API endpoint + payload, CLI command + flags).
2. **Acceptance criteria** — specific behaviors / inputs → outputs / edge cases that MUST work to call it "done".
3. **Scope boundary** — what is explicitly OUT of scope this round.
4. **Non-negotiable constraints** — stack, file locations, naming, backward compatibility, deadlines, performance.
5. **Touchpoints** — which existing files/modules (from scout) will be modified or extended; which contracts must stay stable.

Every clarifying question MUST cite scout findings (file paths) in its options. Abstract options like "Add the feature" without a file path are a failure mode — replace with options of the form "Add to `src/api/users.ts` (matches existing pattern)" or "Create new `src/api/profile.ts`".

Skip when input is an existing plan path (`plan.md` / `phase-*.md`) — the plan already encodes scout output and the 5 dimensions.

## Workflow

Before starting, read `references/failure-catalog.md` for common planning failure modes to avoid.

Execute via `workflow.md`. Step-file architecture — load one step at a time.
Fast mode (`--fast`) uses `workflow-fast.md` (steps 00→03→04→07→08).

**Agile DoR advisory (Phase 1 entry, conditional):** if the parsed plan frontmatter contains a non-empty `jira_tickets:` list AND `agile-story-gates.md` is loaded (Agile context active per `mk:agent-detector` Step 0b), run 1 of `agile-story-gates.md` for each ticket BEFORE generating phase files. Render the advisory checklist; never block — let the user decide. Skip silently when `jira_tickets:` is absent or the rule is not loaded.

```
Step 0: Scope Challenge → trivial (exit) | simple (fast) | complex (hard/deep)
Step 0.5: Intake Packet (conditional: ≥2 external artifacts) → consolidate upstream artifacts, else clean skip
Step 1: Research (hard/deep/parallel/two only) → 2-3 researchers, max 5 calls each
Step 2: Codebase Analysis (hard/deep/parallel/two only) → scout + docs (deep: bounded scope map)
Step 3: Draft Plan → plan.md (≤80 lines) + phase-XX files (12-section template; deep: + phase map; tdd: + regression sections)
Step 4: Semantic Checks → goal/ACs/constraints + structural validation
Step 5: Red Team (hard/deep/parallel/two only) → 4-persona scaling, red-team-findings.md, adjudication
Step 6: Validation Interview (hard/deep/parallel/two only) → 3-5 critical questions with detection keywords, propagate answers
Step 7: Gate 1 → self-check + stop and ask the user in chat (Approve | Modify | Reject)
Step 8: Hydrate Tasks → phase checkboxes → session tasks
Step 9: Post-Plan Handoff → mode-pruned stop and ask the user in chat (cook|validate|red-team|end) → write `handoff.next` to plan.md → STOP
```

## Output Structure

**Fast mode:** Single `plan.md` (goal, context, scope, approach, ACs)
**Hard mode:** Directory with plan.md + phase files:

```
tasks/plans/YYMMDD-name/
├── plan.md              ← overview (≤80 lines)
├── research/            ← researcher reports (hard mode)
├── phase-01-name.md     ← 12-section detail (≤150 lines)
├── phase-02-name.md
└── ...
```

## Gotchas

- **Wrong workflow model**: feature-model on a bug fix skips investigation → confirm type at Step 0
- **Goal describes activity**: "Implement OAuth" vs "Users can log in with OAuth" → rewrite as outcome
- **ACs can't be verified**: "code is clean" blocks Gate 2 → every AC must reference a command/file check
- **Monolithic plan**: plan.md over 80 lines → move detail to phase files or research reports
- **Research disconnected**: findings archived but not cited in plan → Step 3 MUST integrate research into Key Insights
- **Over-planning trivial tasks**: 2-file config change gets full research → Step 0 scope gate exits early
- **Skipping scout on unfamiliar codebases**: → always run mk:scout if codebase is new
- **Using `--deep` to decide architecture**: deep maps a chosen approach; if the approach is unclear, route to `mk:brainstorming` first.
- **Dropping TDD at handoff**: when `tdd_mode=true`, step-09 MUST print cook with `--tdd`; sentinel/env state alone is not a cross-session contract.
- **Post-Plan Handoff is deterministic**: step-09 fires `stop and ask the user in chat`; do NOT auto-invoke the chosen command. User must type it in a fresh session for clean context.
- **`handoff.next` enum is validated**: values outside `{cook, validate, red-team, autobuild, end}` fail `validate-plan.py`.
- **Whole-Plan Consistency Gates W1 / W2 fire after red-team and validation interview**: stage-then-apply algorithm — no edits land until the user resolves any unresolved contradictions. See `references/whole-plan-sweep.md`.
- **`consistency_sweeps` frontmatter is optional**: legacy plans without it still validate as `PLAN_COMPLETE`.
- **Sweep recursion is bounded**: "resolve now" caps at 2 attempts per gate; further unresolved items convert to Risk rows.
- **`.plan-state.json` v1.2 schema is additive**: consumers MUST treat unknown keys (`verification_tier`, `consistency_sweeps_passed`) as optional and default-empty. v1.1 readers ignore them silently.
- **Post-hydration integrity-check failure is a hard stop**: cycle / count-mismatch / missing-metadata failures print an explicit diff and STOP — do NOT auto-recover or silently continue. Human resolution required before step-09. See `references/task-management.md` "Post-Hydration Integrity Checks".
- **Re-analyzing a design source that already has a packet duplicates interpretation**: when a design evidence packet path is present, cite the packet — do NOT call the design source's tools or re-parse its raw JSON. See `references/design-evidence-consumption.md`.

## Known Exceptions

- `references/anthropic-example-plan.md` — filename retained as the source-provenance attribution for the few-shot calibration example. The file content is the appendix of a published harness-design article (Prithvi Rajasekaran, Labs); renaming would obscure the research origin. Future brand-prose audits skip this filename per this documented exception.

## Related Rules

- AGENTS.md (Gates) — Gate 1 hard-stop conditions this skill enforces (plan approval before Phase 3)
- AGENTS.md (Delegation & subagents) — boundary contract; verification sub-task stay READ-ONLY; sweep stays in planner context (never delegated)
