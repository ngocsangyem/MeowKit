# mk:jira-issue

Forks to the `jira-issue` agent (system prompt at `.codex/agents/jira-issue.md`). The skill body is the task brief — the host runtime injects this content into the forked agent.

## Triggers

- "create a bug/task/story in PROJ"
- "show me / get / view / look up PROJ-123"
- "update PROJ-123 priority to High"
- "delete PROJ-123"

## Examples

- Quick create: "create a Bug in PROJ titled 'Login fails on Safari'"
- Templated create: "create a story from the bug template for PROJ"
- Read with projection: "show me PROJ-123 with comments and attachments"
- Update: "set priority to High and add label tech-debt on PROJ-123"
