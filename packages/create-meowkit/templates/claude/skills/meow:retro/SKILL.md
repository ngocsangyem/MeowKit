# /meow:retro — Weekly Engineering Retrospective

Generates a comprehensive engineering retrospective analyzing commit history, work patterns, and code quality metrics. Team-aware: identifies the user running the command, then analyzes every contributor with per-person praise and growth opportunities. Designed for a senior IC/CTO-level builder using Claude Code as a force multiplier.

## When to Use

- User types `/meow:retro` (with optional arguments: `24h`, `14d`, `30d`, `compare`, `global`)
- End of a work week or sprint
- When asked "what did we ship" or "engineering retrospective"

## Workflow

1. **Run preamble** — initialize session, check upgrades, telemetry prompts. See `references/preamble.md`
2. **Parse arguments** — determine time window, mode (standard/compare/global). See `references/data-gathering.md`
3. **Gather raw data** — fetch origin, run 12 parallel git commands. See `references/data-gathering.md`
4. **Compute metrics** — summary table, per-author leaderboard, backlog health, skill usage, eureka moments. See `references/metrics-computation.md`
5. **Analyze time patterns** — hourly histogram, session detection, commit type breakdown, hotspots, PR sizes, focus score. See `references/metrics-computation.md`
6. **Team member analysis** — per-person stats, praise, growth opportunities. See `references/team-analysis.md`
7. **Trends & streaks** — week-over-week trends, shipping streaks, load/compare history. See `references/trends-history.md`
8. **Save retro snapshot** — persist JSON to `.context/retros/`. See `references/trends-history.md`
9. **Write narrative** — structured output with tweetable summary, all sections. See `references/narrative-output.md`
10. **Run telemetry** — log skill completion. See `references/telemetry.md`

For **compare mode**: See `references/compare-mode.md`
For **global mode** (`/retro global`): Skip steps 3-9, follow `references/global-retro.md` instead.
