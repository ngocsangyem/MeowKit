# Step 8: VERSION Bump Question

**CRITICAL — NEVER BUMP VERSION WITHOUT ASKING.**

1. **If VERSION does not exist:** Skip silently.

2. Check if VERSION was already modified on this branch:

```bash
git diff <base>...HEAD -- VERSION
```

3. **If VERSION was NOT bumped:** Use AskUserQuestion:
   - RECOMMENDATION: Choose C (Skip) because docs-only changes rarely warrant a version bump
   - A) Bump PATCH (X.Y.Z+1) — if doc changes ship alongside code changes
   - B) Bump MINOR (X.Y+1.0) — if this is a significant standalone release
   - C) Skip — no version bump needed

4. **If VERSION was already bumped:** Do NOT skip silently. Instead, check whether the bump
   still covers the full scope of changes on this branch:

   a. Read the CHANGELOG entry for the current VERSION. What features does it describe?
   b. Read the full diff (`git diff <base>...HEAD --stat` and `git diff <base>...HEAD --name-only`).
      Are there significant changes (new features, new skills, new commands, major refactors)
      that are NOT mentioned in the CHANGELOG entry for the current version?
   c. **If the CHANGELOG entry covers everything:** Skip — output "VERSION: Already bumped to
      vX.Y.Z, covers all changes."
   d. **If there are significant uncovered changes:** Use AskUserQuestion explaining what the
      current version covers vs what's new, and ask:
      - RECOMMENDATION: Choose A because the new changes warrant their own version
      - A) Bump to next patch (X.Y.Z+1) — give the new changes their own version
      - B) Keep current version — add new changes to the existing CHANGELOG entry
      - C) Skip — leave version as-is, handle later

   The key insight: a VERSION bump set for "feature A" should not silently absorb "feature B"
   if feature B is substantial enough to deserve its own version entry.
