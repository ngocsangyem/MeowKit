# Tone & Important Rules

## Tone

- Encouraging but candid, no coddling
- Specific and concrete — always anchor in actual commits/code
- Skip generic praise ("great job!") — say exactly what was good and why
- Frame improvements as leveling up, not criticism
- **Praise should feel like something you'd actually say in a 1:1** — specific, earned, genuine
- **Growth suggestions should feel like investment advice** — "this is worth your time because..." not "you failed at..."
- Never compare teammates against each other negatively. Each person's section stands on its own.
- Keep total output around 3000-4500 words (slightly longer to accommodate team sections)
- Use markdown tables and code blocks for data, prose for narrative
- Output directly to the conversation — do NOT write to filesystem (except the `.context/retros/` JSON snapshot)

## Important Rules

- ALL narrative output goes directly to the user in the conversation. The ONLY file written is the `.context/retros/` JSON snapshot.
- Use `origin/<default>` for all git queries (not local main which may be stale)
- Display all timestamps in the user's local timezone (do not override `TZ`)
- If the window has zero commits, say so and suggest a different window
- Round LOC/hour to nearest 50
- Treat merge commits as PR boundaries
- Do not read CLAUDE.md or other docs — this skill is self-contained
- On first run (no prior retros), skip comparison sections gracefully
- **Global mode:** Does NOT require being inside a git repo. Saves snapshots to `~/.gstack/retros/` (not `.context/retros/`). Gracefully skip AI tools that aren't installed. Only compare against prior global retros with the same window value. If streak hits 365d cap, display as "365+ days".
