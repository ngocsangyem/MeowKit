description: "Use when writing tests, running validation scripts, or (in TDD mode) enforcing red-green-refactor cycle. Activates during Phase 2 (Test) and Phase 3 (Build). NOT for coverage gap mapping (see mk:nyquist); NOT for sprint contract negotiation (see mk:sprint-contract)."

# Testing Toolkit

Reference guides for testing: TDD red-green-refactor, validation scripts, and visual QA.

## When to Use

- During Phase 2 (Test) for writing tests — failing tests first in TDD mode (`--tdd` / `MEOWKIT_TDD=1`), or any-order tests in default mode
- During Phase 3 (Build) for verifying implementation
- When the `tester` agent needs testing patterns
- For visual QA testing of web applications

## Workflow Integration

Operates in **Phase 2 (Test)** and **Phase 3 (Build)**. Output supports the `tester` agent.

In TDD mode the cycle is RED → GREEN → REFACTOR (failing tests required before implementation). In default mode (TDD off), tests may be written before, alongside, or after implementation — the developer chooses.

## Gotchas

- **Mocks hiding integration failures**: All mocked tests pass but real service calls fail → Use integration tests for critical paths; mock only external third-party services
- **Test coverage metric gamed by trivial assertions**: 100% coverage with `expect(true).toBe(true)` → Measure mutation testing score alongside coverage; flag tests with zero assertions
