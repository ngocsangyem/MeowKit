  re-render issues, or performance improvements. Auto-activates alongside

# React Patterns

React and Next.js performance optimization — 45+ rules across 8 priority categories from Vercel Engineering.

Complements `meow:typescript` (type safety) and `meow:vue` (Vue patterns). This skill covers React-specific performance patterns.

## When to Use

- Writing or reviewing React/Next.js components
- Optimizing bundle size or render performance
- Fixing re-render issues
- Server vs client component decisions
- Data fetching patterns

## Rule Categories (by priority)

Load the relevant reference when working in that area:

| Priority | Category | Reference | Key rules |
|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| CRITICAL | Eliminating waterfalls | `references/async-patterns.md` | Defer await, parallel promises, Suspense boundaries |
| CRITICAL | Bundle size | `references/bundle-optimization.md` | No barrel imports, dynamic imports, defer third-party |
| HIGH | Server performance | `references/server-patterns.md` | React.cache(), LRU cache, parallel fetching, after() |
| MEDIUM | Re-render optimization | `references/rerender-optimization.md` | Derived state, functional setState, memo, transitions |
| MEDIUM | Rendering perf | `references/rendering-patterns.md` | content-visibility, hoist JSX, conditional render |

## Process

1. Identify the performance concern (waterfall? bundle? re-render? server?)
2. Load the matching reference file
3. Apply rules — each rule has: problem, solution, code example
4. Verify improvement (Lighthouse, bundle analyzer, React DevTools)

## Gotchas

- **Premature optimization**: optimizing re-renders before measuring → measure first with React DevTools Profiler
- **Over-memoizing**: wrapping everything in useMemo/React.memo → memo only when profiler shows expensive re-renders
- **Barrel file trap**: importing from index.ts pulls entire module → always import directly from source file

## Workflow Integration

Auto-activates during Phase 3 (Build) when React/Next.js project detected. Loaded by `developer` agent alongside `meow:typescript`.
