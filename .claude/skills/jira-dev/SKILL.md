# mk:jira-dev

Forks to the `jira-dev` agent. Pure artifact generation — the user reviews and runs the resulting `git`/`gh` commands.

## Triggers

- "branch name for PROJ-123"
- "PR description for PROJ-123"
- "parse commits in main..HEAD for issue keys"
- "link this commit to PROJ-123"
- "link this PR to PROJ-123"

## Examples

- Branch: "give me a branch name for PROJ-123"
- PR: "draft a PR title and body from PROJ-123"
- Smart-commit: "generate a 'Closes PROJ-123' footer for my last 5 commits"

## Handoff

`mk:ship` may invoke `bash $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/skills/jira/scripts/jira-as.sh dev branch-name <KEY>` during its branch-creation step (documentation-only — no automatic wiring exists today). Users opt in by passing the Jira key context to `mk:ship`.

- Peer leaves: `mk:ship` (consumes `dev branch-name` + `dev pr-description`), `mk:jira-issue` (issue must exist before branch creation), `mk:jira-lifecycle` (transitions via smart-commit footer)
