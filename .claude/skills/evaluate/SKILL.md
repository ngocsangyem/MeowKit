  Use when grading a running build behaviorally — drives the artifact via
  browser/curl/CLI and grades against rubric criteria with concrete evidence.
  Triggers on /mk:evaluate, "evaluate this build", "grade the running app",
  "check the running site against the spec", or after a generator iteration
  completes. NOT for structural code audit of a diff/PR (see mk:review);
  NOT for static linting (see mk:lint-and-validate).

# mk:evaluate — Behavioral Active Verification

Step-file workflow that drives a running build, probes each rubric criterion via active verification, and produces a graded verdict with runtime evidence. Owned by the `evaluator` agent (Phase 3+).

## When to Use

Activate when:
- User runs `/mk:evaluate <target>` with a URL, file path, or running-app handle
- A generator iteration completes and the harness needs a graded verdict
- After Phase 3 (build) and before Phase 5 (ship) for frontend/fullstack/CLI products
- When asked to "grade the running app", "check the build behaviorally", or "verify against the spec"

Skip when:
- The build has no runnable artifact (pure library, type-only package)
- The task is structural code review only — use `mk:review` instead
- The task is `/mk:fix` simple — overhead exceeds value

## Hard Constraints

1. **Active verification gate** — every verdict MUST include non-empty `evidence/` directory with at least one of: screenshot, HTTP response capture, CLI stdout+exit-code transcript. `validate-verdict.sh` rejects PASS verdicts with empty evidence and converts them to FAIL.
2. **Skeptic persona enforced** — load `prompts/skeptic-persona.md` at session start. Re-anchor before each criterion grading.
3. **Max 15 criteria per session** — split into multiple sessions if rubric composition exceeds. Heuristic: context overflow risk above this threshold.
4. **No source code edits** — evaluator owns `tasks/reviews/*-evalverdict.md` only. Never modifies source files.
5. **Frontend default preset is pruned** — `frontend-app` loads only product-depth, functionality, design-quality, originality (per Phase 2 v2.0.0 audit). Other 3 rubrics opt-in only.

## Workflow

Execute via `workflow.md`. Step-file architecture — load one step at a time.

```
Step 1: Load Rubrics       → compose preset, load skeptic persona, parse sprint contract if exists
Step 2: Boot App           → start the build if not already running (skip if URL given)
Step 3: Probe Criteria     → drive browser/curl/CLI per criterion; capture evidence
Step 4: Grade and Verdict  → score each rubric; write verdict file; run validate-verdict.sh
Step 5: Generator Feedback → produce one-line fix guidance per FAIL/WARN; emit handoff message
```

## Output

- `tasks/reviews/YYMMDD-{slug}-evalverdict.md` — structured verdict (YAML frontmatter + per-rubric sections)
- `tasks/reviews/YYMMDD-{slug}-evalverdict-evidence/` — directory of screenshots, HTTP captures, CLI transcripts
- Returned to caller: `PASS | WARN | FAIL` + path to verdict file + generator feedback summary

## Memory Write

After each completed evaluation, append a summary line to `.claude/memory/review-patterns.md`. Create the file with a header row if it does not exist:

```
| {date} | {artifact-id} | {verdict: PASS/WARN/FAIL} | {top-criterion} | {score} |
```

Use `mkdir -p .claude/memory` before the append to avoid silent failure on missing directory. This persists evaluation patterns across sessions for `mk:elicit` and `mk:review` to reference.

## Verdict Schema

See `step-04-grade-and-verdict.md` for the canonical schema. Frontmatter fields: `task`, `evaluator_run`, `rubric_preset`, `model`, `overall`, `weighted_score`, `hard_fail_triggered`, `iterations`.

## Gotchas

- **Don't grade source code** — that's `mk:review`'s job. If you find yourself reading `.tsx` files instead of clicking buttons, you've drifted into static review
- **Don't trust test pass claims** — tests can pass against mocks while the real endpoint 500s. Run the build yourself
- **Don't auto-load all 7 rubrics** — frontend-app preset is pruned to 4 (Phase 2 v2.0.0). Loading the others duplicates work mk:review/security-rules/qa already do
- **Don't issue PASS without evidence** — the validator will reject it and convert to FAIL. Save yourself the round-trip
- **Don't skip the skeptic persona reload** — leniency drift is the dominant evaluator failure mode (Anthropic harness research)
