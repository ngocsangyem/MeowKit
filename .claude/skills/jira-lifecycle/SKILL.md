# mk:jira-lifecycle

Forks to the `jira-lifecycle` agent. `lifecycle transition` takes the issue key positional + a `--to "Status Name"` flag (or `--id <transition_id>`).

**Workflow discovery is mandatory** before suggesting transitions. The agent reads `tasks/jira-workflows/` (instance-discovered cache) and runs `bash $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/skills/jira/scripts/fetch-workflow.sh <KEY>` if absent. See `references/workflow-discovery.md`. The `references/patterns/*.md` files are illustrative concepts only — they are NOT your project's actual workflow.

## Triggers

- "transition PROJ-123 to In Progress"
- "mark PROJ-123 as Done with resolution Fixed"
- "assign PROJ-123 to john.doe"
- "reopen PROJ-123"
- "release version v1.0.0 in PROJ"

## Examples

- Status change: "move PROJ-123 to In Review with comment 'ready for QA'"
- Resolution-required: "close PROJ-456 with resolution Won't Fix"
- Assignment: "assign all my open PROJ tickets to john.doe" (the agent will refuse — that's bulk; redirect to `mk:jira-bulk`)
