# Commit, Push, PR Creation, and Post-Ship (Steps 6, 6.5, 7, 8, 8.5, 8.75)

## Step 6: Commit (bisectable chunks)

**Goal:** Create small, logical commits that work well with `git bisect` and help LLMs understand what changed.

1. Analyze the diff and group changes into logical commits. Each commit should represent **one coherent change** — not one file, but one logical unit.

2. **Commit ordering** (earlier commits first):
   - **Infrastructure:** migrations, config changes, route additions
   - **Models & services:** new models, services, concerns (with their tests)
   - **Controllers & views:** controllers, views, JS/React components (with their tests)
   - **VERSION + CHANGELOG + TODOS.md:** always in the final commit

3. **Rules for splitting:**
   - A model and its test file go in the same commit
   - A service and its test file go in the same commit
   - A controller, its views, and its test go in the same commit
   - Migrations are their own commit (or grouped with the model they support)
   - Config/route changes can group with the feature they enable
   - If the total diff is small (< 50 lines across < 4 files), a single commit is fine

4. **Each commit must be independently valid** — no broken imports, no references to code that doesn't exist yet. Order commits so dependencies come first.

5. Compose each commit message:
   - First line: `<type>: <summary>` (type = feat/fix/chore/refactor/docs)
   - Body: brief description of what this commit contains
   - Only the **final commit** (VERSION + CHANGELOG) gets the version tag and co-author trailer:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
chore: bump version and changelog (vX.Y.Z.W)

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

## Step 6.5: Verification Gate

**IRON LAW: NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE.**

Before pushing, re-verify if code changed during Steps 4-6:

1. **Test verification:** If ANY code changed after Step 3's test run (fixes from review findings, CHANGELOG edits don't count), re-run the test suite. Paste fresh output. Stale output from Step 3 is NOT acceptable.

2. **Build verification:** If the project has a build step, run it. Paste output.

3. **Rationalization prevention:**
   - "Should work now" → RUN IT.
   - "I'm confident" → Confidence is not evidence.
   - "I already tested earlier" → Code changed since then. Test again.
   - "It's a trivial change" → Trivial changes break production.

**If tests fail here:** STOP. Do not push. Fix the issue and return to Step 3.

Claiming work is complete without verification is dishonesty, not efficiency.

## Step 7: Push

Push to the remote with upstream tracking:

```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

---

## Step 8: Create PR

Create a pull request using `gh`:

```bash
gh pr create --base <base> --title "<type>: <summary>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<bullet points from CHANGELOG>

## Test Coverage
<coverage diagram from Step 3.4, or "All new code paths have test coverage.">
<If Step 3.4 ran: "Tests: {before} → {after} (+{delta} new)">

## Pre-Landing Review
<findings from Step 3.5 code review, or "No issues found.">

## Design Review
<If design review ran: "Design Review (lite): N findings — M auto-fixed, K skipped. AI Slop: clean/N issues.">
<If no frontend files changed: "No frontend files changed — design review skipped.">

## Eval Results
<If evals ran: suite names, pass/fail counts, cost dashboard summary. If skipped: "No prompt-related files changed — evals skipped.">

## Greptile Review
<If Greptile comments were found: bullet list with [FIXED] / [FALSE POSITIVE] / [ALREADY FIXED] tag + one-line summary per comment>
<If no Greptile comments found: "No Greptile comments.">
<If no PR existed during Step 3.75: omit this section entirely>

## Plan Completion
<If plan file found: completion checklist summary from Step 3.45>
<If no plan file: "No plan file detected.">
<If plan items deferred: list deferred items>

## Verification Results
<If verification ran: summary from Step 3.47 (N PASS, M FAIL, K SKIPPED)>
<If skipped: reason (no plan, no server, no verification section)>
<If not applicable: omit this section>

## TODOS
<If items marked complete: bullet list of completed items with version>
<If no items completed: "No TODO items completed in this PR.">
<If TODOS.md created or reorganized: note that>
<If TODOS.md doesn't exist and user skipped: omit this section>

## Test plan
- [x] All Rails tests pass (N runs, 0 failures)
- [x] All Vitest tests pass (N tests)

```

**Output the PR URL** — then proceed to Step 8.5.

## Step 8.5: Auto-invoke /document-release

After the PR is created, automatically sync project documentation. Read the
`document-release/SKILL.md` skill file (adjacent to this skill's directory) and
execute its full workflow:

1. Read the `/document-release` skill: `cat ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../document-release/SKILL.md`
2. Follow its instructions — it reads all .md files in the project, cross-references
   the diff, and updates anything that drifted (README, ARCHITECTURE, CONTRIBUTING,
   CLAUDE.md, TODOS, etc.)
3. If any docs were updated, commit the changes and push to the same branch:
   ```bash
   git add -A && git commit -m "docs: sync documentation with shipped changes" && git push
   ```
4. If no docs needed updating, say "Documentation is current — no updates needed."

This step is automatic. Do not ask the user for confirmation. The goal is zero-friction
doc updates — the user runs `/meow:ship` and documentation stays current without a separate command.

## Step 8.75: Persist ship metrics

Log coverage and plan completion data so `/meow:retro` can track trends:

```bash
eval "$(~/.claude/skills/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)" && mkdir -p ~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG
```

Append to `~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/$BRANCH-reviews.jsonl`:

```bash
echo '{"skill":"ship","timestamp":"'"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"'","coverage_pct":COVERAGE_PCT,"plan_items_total":PLAN_TOTAL,"plan_items_done":PLAN_DONE,"verification_result":"VERIFY_RESULT","version":"VERSION","branch":"BRANCH"}' >> ~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/$BRANCH-reviews.jsonl
```

Substitute from earlier steps:
- **COVERAGE_PCT**: coverage percentage from Step 3.4 diagram (integer, or -1 if undetermined)
- **PLAN_TOTAL**: total plan items extracted in Step 3.45 (0 if no plan file)
- **PLAN_DONE**: count of DONE + CHANGED items from Step 3.45 (0 if no plan file)
- **VERIFY_RESULT**: "pass", "fail", or "skipped" from Step 3.47
- **VERSION**: from the VERSION file
- **BRANCH**: current branch name

This step is automatic — never skip it, never ask for confirmation.
