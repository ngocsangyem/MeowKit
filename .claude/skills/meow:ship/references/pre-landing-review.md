# Pre-Landing Review, Design Review, and PR Comment Resolution (Steps 3.5 and 3.75)

## Step 3.5: Pre-Landing Review

Review the diff for structural issues that tests don't catch.

1. Read `.claude/skills/meow:review/checklist.md`. If the file cannot be read, **STOP** and report the error.

2. Run `git diff origin/<base>` to get the full diff (scoped to feature changes against the freshly-fetched base branch).

3. Apply the review checklist in two passes:
   - **Pass 1 (CRITICAL):** SQL & Data Safety, LLM Output Trust Boundary
   - **Pass 2 (INFORMATIONAL):** All remaining categories

## Design Review (conditional, diff-scoped)

Check if the diff touches frontend files using `meowkit-diff-scope`:

```bash
source <(.claude/scripts/bin/meowkit-diff-scope <base> 2>/dev/null)
```

**If `SCOPE_FRONTEND=false`:** Skip design review silently. No output.

**If `SCOPE_FRONTEND=true`:**

1. **Check for DESIGN.md.** If `DESIGN.md` or `design-system.md` exists in the repo root, read it. All design findings are calibrated against it — patterns blessed in DESIGN.md are not flagged. If not found, use universal design principles.

2. **Read `.claude/skills/meow:review/design-checklist.md`.** If the file cannot be read, skip design review with a note: "Design checklist not found — skipping design review."

3. **Read each changed frontend file** (full file, not just diff hunks). Frontend files are identified by the patterns listed in the checklist.

4. **Apply the design checklist** against the changed files. For each item:
   - **[HIGH] mechanical CSS fix** (`outline: none`, `!important`, `font-size < 16px`): classify as AUTO-FIX
   - **[HIGH/MEDIUM] design judgment needed**: classify as ASK
   - **[LOW] intent-based detection**: present as "Possible — verify visually or run /design-review"

5. **Include findings** in the review output under a "Design Review" header, following the output format in the checklist. Design findings merge with code review findings into the same Fix-First flow.

6. **Log the result** for the Review Readiness Dashboard:

```bash
.claude/scripts/bin/meowkit-review-log '{"skill":"design-review-lite","timestamp":"TIMESTAMP","status":"STATUS","findings":N,"auto_fixed":M,"commit":"COMMIT"}'
```

Substitute: TIMESTAMP = ISO 8601 datetime, STATUS = "clean" if 0 findings or "issues_found", N = total findings, M = auto-fixed count, COMMIT = output of `git rev-parse --short HEAD`.

7. **Codex design voice** (optional, automatic if available):

```bash
which codex 2>/dev/null && echo "CODEX_AVAILABLE" || echo "CODEX_NOT_AVAILABLE"
```

If Codex is available, run a lightweight design check on the diff:

```bash
TMPERR_DRL=$(mktemp /tmp/codex-drl-XXXXXXXX)
codex exec "Review the git diff on this branch. Run 7 litmus checks (YES/NO each): 1. Brand/product unmistakable in first screen? 2. One strong visual anchor present? 3. Page understandable by scanning headlines only? 4. Each section has one job? 5. Are cards actually necessary? 6. Does motion improve hierarchy or atmosphere? 7. Would design feel premium with all decorative shadows removed? Flag any hard rejections: 1. Generic SaaS card grid as first impression 2. Beautiful image with weak brand 3. Strong headline with no clear action 4. Busy imagery behind text 5. Sections repeating same mood statement 6. Carousel with no narrative purpose 7. App UI made of stacked cards instead of layout 5 most important design findings only. Reference file:line." -s read-only -c 'model_reasoning_effort="high"' --enable web_search_cached 2>"$TMPERR_DRL"
```

Use a 5-minute timeout (`timeout: 300000`). After the command completes, read stderr:
```bash
cat "$TMPERR_DRL" && rm -f "$TMPERR_DRL"
```

**Error handling:** All errors are non-blocking. On auth failure, timeout, or empty response — skip with a brief note and continue.

Present Codex output under a `CODEX (design):` header, merged with the checklist findings above.

   Include any design findings alongside the code review findings. They follow the same Fix-First flow below.

4. **Classify each finding as AUTO-FIX or ASK** per the Fix-First Heuristic in
   checklist.md. Critical findings lean toward ASK; informational lean toward AUTO-FIX.

5. **Auto-fix all AUTO-FIX items.** Apply each fix. Output one line per fix:
   `[AUTO-FIXED] [file:line] Problem → what you did`

6. **If ASK items remain,** present them in ONE AskUserQuestion:
   - List each with number, severity, problem, recommended fix
   - Per-item options: A) Fix  B) Skip
   - Overall RECOMMENDATION
   - If 3 or fewer ASK items, you may use individual AskUserQuestion calls instead

7. **After all fixes (auto + user-approved):**
   - If ANY fixes were applied: commit fixed files by name (`git add <fixed-files> && git commit -m "fix: pre-landing review fixes"`), then **STOP** and tell the user to run `/meow:ship` again to re-test.
   - If no fixes applied (all ASK items skipped, or no issues found): continue to Step 4.

8. Output summary: `Pre-Landing Review: N issues — M auto-fixed, K asked (J fixed, L skipped)`

   If no issues found: `Pre-Landing Review: No issues found.`

Save the review output — it goes into the PR body in Step 8.

## Step 3.75: Address PR review comments (if PR exists)

If a PR exists, fetch review comments from GitHub:
```bash
gh pr view --json reviewRequests,reviews,comments -q '.reviews[].body, .comments[].body' 2>/dev/null || true
```

**If no PR, no comments, or `gh` fails:** Skip silently. Continue to Step 4.

**If review comments are found:**

For each comment, classify and handle:

**VALID & ACTIONABLE:** Use AskUserQuestion:
- Show the comment with file:line reference
- Options: A) Fix now, B) Acknowledge and ship anyway, C) Dismiss as false positive
- If fixed: commit with `git commit -m "fix: address review comment — <brief>"`, log to `.claude/memory/reviews.jsonl`

**ALREADY ADDRESSED:** Note what was done and the commit SHA. No user action needed.

**FALSE POSITIVE:** Show evidence for why it's incorrect. Let user decide to dismiss or fix anyway.

**After all comments resolved:** If fixes were applied, re-run tests (Step 3) before continuing.
