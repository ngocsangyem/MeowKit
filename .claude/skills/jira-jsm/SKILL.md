# mk:jira-jsm

Forks to the `jira-jsm` agent. Service Management (JSM) operations — service desks, requests, SLAs, customers, organizations, queues, approvals, request types.

## Triggers

- "create JSM request in service desk 'IT Support'"
- "list service desks"
- "SLA status for KEY-123"
- "approve request KEY-123"
- "list queue 'Tier 1 Support'"
- "add comment to JSM request KEY-123" (agent will confirm internal vs public)

## Examples

- Get service desk status: "show me the queues for service desk 'IT Support'"
- Customer-facing comment: "add public comment to KEY-123: '<message>'" → agent confirms internal-vs-public per safety-framework.

## Required Permissions

JSM-licensed tenant + agent or admin role. Insufficient permission → exit code 3.

## Limitations

- 8 sub-domains, ~45 verbs total — see `jira-as jsm <sub-domain> --help` for the authoritative flag list.
- Internal-vs-public comments are a privacy concern; the agent enforces explicit confirmation before posting customer-facing content.
