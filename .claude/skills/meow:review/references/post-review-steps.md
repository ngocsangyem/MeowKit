# Post-Review Steps

## Step 5.5: TODOS cross-reference

Read `TODOS.md` in the repository root (if it exists). Cross-reference the PR against open TODOs:

- **Does this PR close any open TODOs?** If yes, note which items in your output: "This PR addresses TODO: <title>"
- **Does this PR create work that should become a TODO?** If yes, flag it as an informational finding.
- **Are there related TODOs that provide context for this review?** If yes, reference them when discussing related findings.

If TODOS.md doesn't exist, skip this step silently.

## Step 5.6: Documentation staleness check

Cross-reference the diff against documentation files. For each `.md` file in the repo root (README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CLAUDE.md, etc.):

1. Check if code changes in the diff affect features, components, or workflows described in that doc file.
2. If the doc file was NOT updated in this branch but the code it describes WAS changed, flag it as an INFORMATIONAL finding:
   "Documentation may be stale: [file] describes [feature/component] but code changed in this branch. Consider running `/document-release`."

This is informational only — never critical. The fix action is `/document-release`.

If no documentation files exist, skip this step silently.

## Step 5.8: Persist Eng Review result

After all review passes complete, persist the final `/meow:review` outcome so `/meow:ship` can
recognize that Eng Review was run on this branch.

Run:

```bash
.claude/scripts/bin/meowkit-review-log '{"skill":"review","timestamp":"TIMESTAMP","status":"STATUS","issues_found":N,"critical":N,"informational":N,"commit":"COMMIT"}'
```

Substitute:
- `TIMESTAMP` = ISO 8601 datetime
- `STATUS` = `"clean"` if there are no remaining unresolved findings after Fix-First handling and adversarial review, otherwise `"issues_found"`
- `issues_found` = total remaining unresolved findings
- `critical` = remaining unresolved critical findings
- `informational` = remaining unresolved informational findings
- `COMMIT` = output of `git rev-parse --short HEAD`

If the review exits early before a real review completes (for example, no diff against the base branch), do **not** write this entry.

## Important Rules

- **Read the FULL diff before commenting.** Do not flag issues already addressed in the diff.
- **Fix-first, not read-only.** AUTO-FIX items are applied directly. ASK items are only applied after user approval. Never commit, push, or create PRs — that's /ship's job.
- **Be terse.** One line problem, one line fix. No preamble.
- **Only flag real problems.** Skip anything that's fine.
- **Use the reviewer agent for all review comment replies.** Every reply includes evidence. Never post vague replies.
