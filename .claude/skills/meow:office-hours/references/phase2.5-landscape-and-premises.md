# Phase 2.5: Related Design Discovery

After the user states the problem (first question in Phase 2A or 2B), search existing design docs for keyword overlap.

Extract 3-5 significant keywords from the user's problem statement and grep across design docs:
```bash
grep -li "<keyword1>\|<keyword2>\|<keyword3>" ~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/*-design-*.md 2>/dev/null
```

If matches found, read the matching design docs and surface them:
- "FYI: Related design found — '{title}' by {user} on {date} (branch: {branch}). Key overlap: {1-line summary of relevant section}."
- Ask via AskUserQuestion: "Should we build on this prior design or start fresh?"

This enables cross-team discovery — multiple users exploring the same project will see each other's design docs in `~/.gstack/projects/`.

If no matches found, proceed silently.

# Phase 2.75: Landscape Awareness

Read ETHOS.md for the full Search Before Building framework (three layers, eureka moments). The preamble's Search Before Building section has the ETHOS.md path.

After understanding the problem through questioning, search for what the world thinks. This is NOT competitive research (that's /design-consultation's job). This is understanding conventional wisdom so you can evaluate where it's wrong.

**Privacy gate:** Before searching, use AskUserQuestion: "I'd like to search for what the world thinks about this space to inform our discussion. This sends generalized category terms (not your specific idea) to a search provider. OK to proceed?"
Options: A) Yes, search away  B) Skip — keep this session private
If B: skip this phase entirely and proceed to Phase 3. Use only in-distribution knowledge.

When searching, use **generalized category terms** — never the user's specific product name, proprietary concept, or stealth idea. For example, search "task management app landscape" not "SuperTodo AI-powered task killer."

If WebSearch is unavailable, skip this phase and note: "Search unavailable — proceeding with in-distribution knowledge only."

**Startup mode:** WebSearch for:
- "[problem space] startup approach {current year}"
- "[problem space] common mistakes"
- "why [incumbent solution] fails" OR "why [incumbent solution] works"

**Builder mode:** WebSearch for:
- "[thing being built] existing solutions"
- "[thing being built] open source alternatives"
- "best [thing category] {current year}"

Read the top 2-3 results. Run the three-layer synthesis:
- **[Layer 1]** What does everyone already know about this space?
- **[Layer 2]** What are the search results and current discourse saying?
- **[Layer 3]** Given what WE learned in Phase 2A/2B — is there a reason the conventional approach is wrong?

**Eureka check:** If Layer 3 reasoning reveals a genuine insight, name it: "EUREKA: Everyone does X because they assume [assumption]. But [evidence from our conversation] suggests that's wrong here. This means [implication]." Log the eureka moment (see preamble).

If no eureka moment exists, say: "The conventional wisdom seems sound here. Let's build on it." Proceed to Phase 3.

**Important:** This search feeds Phase 3 (Premise Challenge). If you found reasons the conventional approach fails, those become premises to challenge. If conventional wisdom is solid, that raises the bar for any premise that contradicts it.

# Phase 3: Premise Challenge

Before proposing solutions, challenge the premises:

1. **Is this the right problem?** Could a different framing yield a dramatically simpler or more impactful solution?
2. **What happens if we do nothing?** Real pain point or hypothetical one?
3. **What existing code already partially solves this?** Map existing patterns, utilities, and flows that could be reused.
4. **If the deliverable is a new artifact** (CLI binary, library, package, container image, mobile app): **how will users get it?** Code without distribution is code nobody can use. The design must include a distribution channel (GitHub Releases, package manager, container registry, app store) and CI/CD pipeline — or explicitly defer it.
5. **Startup mode only:** Synthesize the diagnostic evidence from Phase 2A. Does it support this direction? Where are the gaps?

Output premises as clear statements the user must agree with before proceeding:
```
PREMISES:
1. [statement] — agree/disagree?
2. [statement] — agree/disagree?
3. [statement] — agree/disagree?
```

Use AskUserQuestion to confirm. If the user disagrees with a premise, revise understanding and loop back.

# Phase 3.5: Cross-Model Second Opinion (optional)

**Binary check first — no question if unavailable:**

```bash
which codex 2>/dev/null && echo "CODEX_AVAILABLE" || echo "CODEX_NOT_AVAILABLE"
```

If `CODEX_NOT_AVAILABLE`: skip Phase 3.5 entirely — no message, no AskUserQuestion. Proceed directly to Phase 4.

If `CODEX_AVAILABLE`: use AskUserQuestion:

> Want a second opinion from a different AI model? Codex will independently review your problem statement, key answers, premises, and any landscape findings from this session. It hasn't seen this conversation — it gets a structured summary. Usually takes 2-5 minutes.
> A) Yes, get a second opinion
> B) No, proceed to alternatives

If B: skip Phase 3.5 entirely. Remember that Codex did NOT run (affects design doc, founder signals, and Phase 4 below).

**If A: Run the Codex cold read.**

1. Assemble a structured context block from Phases 1-3:
   - Mode (Startup or Builder)
   - Problem statement (from Phase 1)
   - Key answers from Phase 2A/2B (summarize each Q&A in 1-2 sentences, include verbatim user quotes)
   - Landscape findings (from Phase 2.75, if search was run)
   - Agreed premises (from Phase 3)
   - Codebase context (project name, languages, recent activity)

2. **Write the assembled prompt to a temp file** (prevents shell injection from user-derived content):

```bash
CODEX_PROMPT_FILE=$(mktemp /tmp/gstack-codex-oh-XXXXXXXX.txt)
```

Write the full prompt (context block + instructions) to this file. Use the mode-appropriate variant:

**Startup mode instructions:** "You are an independent technical advisor reading a transcript of a startup brainstorming session. [CONTEXT BLOCK HERE]. Your job: 1) What is the STRONGEST version of what this person is trying to build? Steelman it in 2-3 sentences. 2) What is the ONE thing from their answers that reveals the most about what they should actually build? Quote it and explain why. 3) Name ONE agreed premise you think is wrong, and what evidence would prove you right. 4) If you had 48 hours and one engineer to build a prototype, what would you build? Be specific — tech stack, features, what you'd skip. Be direct. Be terse. No preamble."

**Builder mode instructions:** "You are an independent technical advisor reading a transcript of a builder brainstorming session. [CONTEXT BLOCK HERE]. Your job: 1) What is the COOLEST version of this they haven't considered? 2) What's the ONE thing from their answers that reveals what excites them most? Quote it. 3) What existing open source project or tool gets them 50% of the way there — and what's the 50% they'd need to build? 4) If you had a weekend to build this, what would you build first? Be specific. Be direct. No preamble."

3. Run Codex:

```bash
TMPERR_OH=$(mktemp /tmp/codex-oh-err-XXXXXXXX)
codex exec "$(cat "$CODEX_PROMPT_FILE")" -s read-only -c 'model_reasoning_effort="xhigh"' --enable web_search_cached 2>"$TMPERR_OH"
```

Use a 5-minute timeout (`timeout: 300000`). After the command completes, read stderr:
```bash
cat "$TMPERR_OH"
rm -f "$TMPERR_OH" "$CODEX_PROMPT_FILE"
```

**Error handling:** All errors are non-blocking — Codex second opinion is a quality enhancement, not a prerequisite.
- **Auth failure:** If stderr contains "auth", "login", "unauthorized", or "API key": "Codex authentication failed. Run `codex login` to authenticate. Skipping second opinion."
- **Timeout:** "Codex timed out after 5 minutes. Skipping second opinion."
- **Empty response:** "Codex returned no response. Stderr: <paste relevant error>. Skipping second opinion."

On any error, proceed to Phase 4 — do NOT fall back to a Claude subagent (this is brainstorming, not adversarial review).

4. **Presentation:**

```
SECOND OPINION (Codex):
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
<full codex output, verbatim — do not truncate or summarize>
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

5. **Cross-model synthesis:** After presenting Codex output, provide 3-5 bullet synthesis:
   - Where Claude agrees with Codex
   - Where Claude disagrees and why
   - Whether Codex's challenged premise changes Claude's recommendation

6. **Premise revision check:** If Codex challenged an agreed premise, use AskUserQuestion:

> Codex challenged premise #{N}: "{premise text}". Their argument: "{reasoning}".
> A) Revise this premise based on Codex's input
> B) Keep the original premise — proceed to alternatives

If A: revise the premise and note the revision. If B: proceed (and note that the user defended this premise with reasoning — this is a founder signal if they articulate WHY they disagree, not just dismiss).
