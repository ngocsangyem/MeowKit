# mk:jira-search

Forks to the `jira-search` agent. JQL is positional on `search query` and `search validate`; flags everywhere else. The agent enforces JQL sanitization for any user-derived term via `scripts/jql-sanitize.sh`.

## Triggers

- "search jira for ..."
- "find issues where assignee = me and sprint is open"
- "build a jql for ..."
- "export the search to /tmp/out.csv"
- "list / create / update / delete a saved filter"

## Examples

- "find unresolved bugs in PROJ created in the last 7 days, top 20"
- "validate this jql: project = PROJ AND status = 'In Progress'"
- "save a filter named 'My open bugs' with this jql: ..."
