# Chom — Copy-Cat, Replicate & Adapt

Analyze external systems, repos, apps, or ideas and produce a spec for replicating them in your project.

Principles: understand before copy | challenge before plan | adapt to YOUR stack

## Usage

```
/mk:chom <github-url|web-url|local-path|description> [feature] [--compare|--copy|--improve|--port] [--lean|--auto]
```

Modes (all user-explicit — chom does NOT auto-derive adaptation depth):

- `--compare`: side-by-side analysis only (phases 1–3), no decision or handoff
- `--copy`: user intent = transplant with minimal changes; biases Phase 3 toward compatibility gaps
- `--improve`: user intent = adapt anti-patterns during port; biases Phase 3 toward anti-pattern detection
- `--port`: user intent = rewrite idiomatically for local stack; biases Phase 3 toward idiom translation
- no flag: full 6-phase workflow, emits Replication Spec without declaring adaptation depth

Speed flags (default OFF):

- `--lean`: skip Phase 1 researcher-agent background gathering. HARD GATE still enforced.
- `--auto`: auto-approve non-HARD-GATE steps. HARD GATE still requires human approval.

**Migration (v1 → v2):** `--analyze` (v1 default) now aliases the no-flag default and emits a deprecation notice. Removed in v1.2.

## Intent Detection (keyword → suggested mode)

If the user provides natural-language mode hints, map them to an explicit flag:

| User says | Suggested flag |
|-----------|----------------|
| "compare", "vs", "how does X do Y" | `--compare` |
| "copy", "1:1", "exact", "as-is" | `--copy` |
| "adapt", "improve", "like how X does it" | `--improve` |
| "port", "rewrite", "convert", "steal", "bring from" | `--port` |

If no hint and no flag, run no-flag default (full workflow, no mode declaration in handoff).

## Input Routing

Detect input type FIRST, then route:

| Input                                    | Detection              | Tool                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Git URL (`github.com/*`, `gitlab.com/*`) | URL contains git host  | `git clone --depth 1` → `mk:scout`                   |
| Web URL (`https://...`)                  | URL, not git host      | `mk:web-to-markdown` (static) or `mk:agent-browser` (SPA) |
| Local path (`./`, `../`, `/`)            | Starts with `.` or `/` | Direct Read/Glob                                       |
| Freeform text                            | No URL or path         | `researcher` agent via Task() (WebSearch)              |
| Image/screenshot                         | Image file extension   | `mk:multimodal` (Gemini vision)                      |

Clean up cloned repos after analysis.

## Workflow

```
[1. Recon] → [2. Map] → [3. Analyze] → [4. Challenge] ══ HARD GATE ══ [5. Decision] → [6. Handoff]
```

Hard gate: Phase 4 must complete and get human approval before Phase 5. HARD GATE is non-bypassable — no flag (including `--lean` or `--auto`) skips human approval here.

### 1. Recon

Route input per table above. Always also read local `docs/project-context.md` for YOUR project's stack.
For git repos: clone shallow, run `mk:scout` for architecture fingerprint.
For web URLs: fetch content, capture structure and behavior.

`--lean` effect depends on input type:
- **freeform text input:** skip the `researcher` agent background gathering; proceed to Phase 2 with only the user's description + `docs/project-context.md`
- **git URL / local path:** no-op (scout is the primary recon tool and is not skipped; HARD GATE compensates for reduced context)
- **web URL:** no-op (fetch is primary)
- **image/screenshot:** no-op (multimodal is primary)

### 2. Map

Build dependency matrix: source components → local equivalents (EXISTS / NEW / CONFLICT).
For each component: what exists locally, what needs building, what libraries are needed.

### 3. Analyze

Trace execution flow, data model, API contracts, UX patterns. Understand WHY, not just HOW.

Mode-specific focus when the user passed an explicit mode:
- `--copy`: compatibility gaps and minimum adaptation needed
- `--improve`: anti-patterns to replace during adoption
- `--port`: idiomatic translation into local patterns
- `--compare` or no flag: architectural differences and trade-offs

Escalation: if the feature has ≥3 architectural layers OR stateful workflows, emit handoff text: "Complex flow detected. Before Phase 4, trace via /mk:sequential-thinking, then return to chom." Do NOT auto-invoke any skill.

For `--compare`: produce Comparison Report and STOP here.

### 4. Challenge

Load `references/challenge-framework.md`. Ask 7 questions. Score risk. Present decision matrix.
Get human approval before continuing. If risk ≥ 5: recommend rejection.

### 5. Decision

Go/no-go. If go: formalize Replication Spec (no mode declaration — the user's flag, if any, is noted but chom does not pick `--copy`/`--improve`/`--port` on the user's behalf). If no-go: Rejection Report with reasoning.

### 6. Handoff

Output Replication Spec + handoff text:

```
Replication Spec ready.

Challenge summary: <N> stack-fit reds, <N> data-model red, <N> blast-radius reds.
Risk level: <low|medium|high> (per challenge-framework.md 0-2 low / 3-4 medium / 5+ high).

To implement, run:
  /mk:plan-creator "Replicate [feature] from [source]"

To bias future chom analysis toward a specific adaptation depth, re-invoke with:
  /mk:chom [source] --copy | --improve | --port
```

## Output: Replication Spec

```markdown
# Replication Spec: [Feature/System Name]

## 1. Source — name, URL, tech stack, what we're replicating
## 2. What to Build — specific features/patterns to replicate
## 3. Stack Fit — maps to our stack (exists / new / conflicts)
## 4. Risks & Effort — what's hard, estimated complexity
## 5. Recommendation — replicate / adapt / reject + next step
```

Handoff text enriches this with challenge reds + risk score.

## Output: Comparison Report (--compare)

Same as Replication Spec but replace sections 2+5 with Head-to-Head table + Takeaways. Print to conversation; do not write to disk unless user explicitly asks (the report is single-use analysis, not a durable artifact).

## Boundary Rules

This skill emits handoff text. It does NOT invoke any other skill mid-flow — including `/mk:plan-creator`, `/mk:brainstorming`, `/mk:cook`, `/mk:sequential-thinking`.

This is chom's design choice, not a a platform rule. Skills *can* reference other skills and the model may invoke them; chom opts out because mid-flow invocations of other orchestration skills (`plan-creator`, `brainstorming`, `cook`) would break phase ownership — each of those skills has its own multi-phase workflow that would interleave with chom's HARD GATE discipline. chom's job ends at Phase 6 Handoff; the user invokes the next skill.

HARD GATE (Phase 4 human approval) is non-bypassable. No flag, including `--lean` or `--auto`, skips this step.

## Error Recovery

- Source private/missing → ask for access or alternative
- Source too large → ask user to narrow scope with feature hint
- Source empty / unreachable / invalid → stop, report what was attempted, ask user to verify URL or path
- Live app behind auth → ask for screenshots or description
- Challenge reveals blocker → offer `--compare` fallback
- Stack mismatch too large → auto-switch to `--compare`
- Risk ≥ 5 → reject with Rejection Report

## Gotchas

- **chom never declares adaptation depth.** Pick `--copy`/`--improve`/`--port` explicitly if you want the analysis biased toward that intent. No-flag runs emit a Replication Spec without mode declaration.
- **API-surface queries use `/mk:pack --compress`**, not chom. If the question is "what's the public API of library X" rather than "should we replicate it," pack's Tree-sitter signature extraction is the right tool. chom is for replication decisions, not API exploration.
- **3+ layers trigger sequential-thinking handoff**, not auto-invocation. Trace the flow via `/mk:sequential-thinking`, then return to chom.
- **HARD GATE applies in all modes**, including `--lean` and `--auto`. Phase 4 human approval is never skipped.
- **No local context = generic advice**: always read `docs/project-context.md` first. Without it, recommendations won't fit your stack.
- **"Obvious" copies hide complexity**: auth flows, data models, API contracts — the challenge phase is NEVER skipped.
- **chom never chains into other skills mid-flow**: handoff text only. USER invokes plan-creator / cook / sequential-thinking. See §Boundary Rules for rationale.
- **Spec ≠ code**: output describes WHAT and WHY, never HOW. No code blocks in specs.
