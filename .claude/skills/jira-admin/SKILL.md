# mk:jira-admin

Forks to the `jira-admin` agent. Highest-blast-radius leaf in the family.

## Triggers

- "create JIRA project"
- "list users"
- "delete user USERNAME"
- "list permission schemes"
- "create group NAME"
- "enable automation rule X on PROJ"

## Examples

- Project create: "create project KEY 'Project Name' as Software-Scrum"
- Project delete (DESTRUCTIVE): "delete project STAGING" → agent enforces 2-step token confirmation: human types literal project key to confirm.
- User deactivate: "deactivate user alice@..." (preferred over delete — preserves attribution)

## Required Permissions

Admin role. Insufficient permission → exit code 3.

## DESTRUCTIVE Operations

- `project delete` — IRREVERSIBLE
- `user delete` — IRREVERSIBLE (use `deactivate` instead when possible)
- `group delete` with members — affects member access globally

The agent enforces 2-step token confirmation for these. The skill triggers them via natural language; the agent never auto-executes without explicit human-typed confirmation.

## Limitations

- 11 sub-domains, ~65 verbs total — see `jira-as admin <sub-domain> --help` for the authoritative flag list.

- Peer leaves: `mk:jira-fields` (field admin overlap; `fields create` requires admin), `mk:jira-jsm` (JSM-specific admin lives in jira-jsm). Most users invoke `mk:jira-admin` once per project setup, then never again.
