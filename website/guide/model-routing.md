# Model Routing

MeowKit declares complexity before every task, ensuring trivial tasks don't burn expensive models and complex tasks get the reasoning power they need.

## Routing table

| Task type | Model tier | Examples |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Trivial** | Cheapest (Haiku) | Rename, typo, format, version bump, config change |
| **Standard** | Default (Sonnet) | Feature (<5 files), bug fix, test writing, API endpoint |
| **Complex** | Best (Opus) | Architecture, security audit, multi-module refactor, auth/payments |

## How it works

The orchestrator agent classifies every incoming task and prints:

```
Task complexity: STANDARD → using Sonnet
```

### Escalation rules

- **Always Complex:** Authentication, payment processing, database schema, security audit
- **Never downgrade:** Once assigned, a task stays at its tier for the entire session
- **Code review always Complex:** Structural audits need the highest reasoning capability

## Scale-Adaptive Intelligence (Phase 0)

Before the orchestrator applies manual classification, MeowKit runs **domain-based routing** via the `mk:scale-routing` skill. It reads keywords from the task description and matches them against `domain-complexity.csv`.

```
Task: "Add Stripe payment checkout"
         │
         ▼
mk:scale-routing
  → domain: fintech
  → level: high
  → OVERRIDE → COMPLEX tier (no manual override possible)
```

### Domain routing table (examples)

| Domain | Keywords | Level | Effect |
|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| fintech | payment, stripe, billing, invoice | high | Force COMPLEX |
| healthcare | hipaa, phi, ehr, patient data | high | Force COMPLEX |
| auth | oauth, jwt, session, credentials | high | Force COMPLEX |
| docs | readme, changelog, comment | low | Allow one-shot |
| config | env, .yaml, version bump | low | Allow one-shot |

When level is `low` AND the task has zero blast radius, Gate 1 is bypassed (same behavior as `/mk:fix --quick`).

### Extending the CSV

The `domain-complexity.csv` file is user-editable. Add rows for your project's specific domains:

```csv
domain,keywords,level,workflow
payments,braintree;adyen;paypal,high,full
internal-tools,admin;dashboard;report,low,one-shot
```

### Anti-rationalization hardening

Scale-routing verdicts cannot be downgraded mid-task. If the CSV returns COMPLEX, the agent **cannot** argue its way to a cheaper tier. No exceptions.

## Planning Depth Per Mode

Each workflow mode declares a **Planning Depth** — the number of researchers that run before the planner writes the plan.

| Mode | Researchers | Research approach |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| `strict` | 2 (parallel) | Competing approaches — each researcher argues a different design |
| `architect` | 2 (parallel) | Competing approaches — same as strict |
| `default` | 1 | Standard depth |
| `audit` | 1 | Security-focused |
| `fast` | 0 | Skip research |
| `cost-saver` | 0 | Skip research, minimize tokens |
| `document` | 0 | Skip research — docs tasks don't need it |

`strict` and `architect` use competing approaches to surface trade-offs that single-researcher planning misses. The synthesis step resolves the competition into a single recommended path before Gate 1.

## Adaptive Density (Harness Pipelines)

When using `/mk:harness`, the scaffolding density (`MINIMAL` / `FULL` / `LEAN`) auto-adjusts based on model tier per the dead-weight thesis. Opus 4.6+ with auto-compaction degrades under full scaffolding; capable models need less ceremony, not more.

| Tier | Model | Density |
|------|-------|---------|
| TRIVIAL | Haiku | MINIMAL — short-circuits to `mk:cook` |
| STANDARD | Sonnet | FULL — contract + 1–3 iterations |
| COMPLEX | Opus 4.5 | FULL — same as Sonnet |
| COMPLEX | Opus 4.6+ | LEAN — single-session, contract optional |

**Auto-detection (v2.3.0):** `model-detector.cjs` (SessionStart handler) reads the `model` field from Claude Code's SessionStart stdin and writes the tier + density to `session-state/detected-model.json`. Detection cascade:

1. Stdin `model` field (primary — no env var required)
2. `MEOWKIT_MODEL_HINT` env var (fallback)
3. Default: STANDARD tier → FULL density

`MEOWKIT_MODEL_HINT` is now a fallback, not a requirement. Override: `MEOWKIT_HARNESS_MODE=MINIMAL|FULL|LEAN`. See [Adaptive Density](/guide/adaptive-density) for the full matrix.

## Agent default models

| Agent | Default | Upgrades to Opus when |
|-------|---------|----------------------|
| orchestrator | Haiku | Never (routing only) |
| planner | Sonnet | Complex multi-phase planning |
| architect | Sonnet | Schema design, migrations |
| developer | Sonnet | Never |
| reviewer | Sonnet | Security-critical reviews |
| security | Sonnet | Full audits |
| analyst | Haiku | Never |
