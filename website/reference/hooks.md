# Hooks

MeowKit uses lifecycle hooks to enforce discipline at the tool level. Some hooks are registered in `.claude/settings.json` (automatic), others are invoked by skills.

## Registered hooks (automatic)

These run automatically via Claude Code's hook system:

| Hook | Type | Trigger | What it does | Blocks? |
|------|------|---------|-------------|---------|
| `post-write.sh` | PostToolUse | Edit, Write | Security scan: secrets, `any` type, SQL injection, XSS, destructive patterns | Yes (exit 2) |
| `learning-observer.sh` | PostToolUse | Edit, Write | Detect churn patterns (file edited 3+ times); feeds into post-session retroactive capture | No |
| `post-session.sh` | Stop | Session end | Capture session data to `.claude/memory/` | No |

## Skill-embedded hooks

These are registered in SKILL.md frontmatter and run when those skills are active:

| Hook | Skill | Trigger | What it does |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `check-freeze.sh` | meow:freeze | Edit, Write | Block edits outside frozen directory |
| `check-careful.sh` | meow:careful | Bash | Warn on destructive commands (rm -rf, DROP TABLE) |

## Skill-invoked scripts

These run when specific skills call them:

| Script | Phase | What it does | Blocks? |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `pre-task-check.sh` | Any | Prompt injection pattern detection | Yes (BLOCK on injection) |
| `pre-implement.sh` | Phase 2-3 | TDD gate — blocks without failing test | Yes |
| `pre-ship.sh` | Phase 5 | Test + lint + typecheck | Yes |
| `cost-meter.sh` | Any | Token usage tracking | No |

## Hook runtime profiling

The `MEOW_HOOK_PROFILE` environment variable controls which hooks are active. Set it in your `.env` file or shell before starting a Claude Code session.

| Profile | Hooks Active | Use When |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `strict` | All hooks | COMPLEX tasks, security-critical work |
| `standard` | All except `cost-meter.sh`, `post-session.sh` | Default — everyday development |
| `fast` | `gate-enforcement.sh`, `privacy-block.sh`, `project-context-loader.sh` only | Rapid iteration, prototyping |

```bash
# Set in .env or shell
MEOW_HOOK_PROFILE=fast
```

### Per-hook profile classification

| Hook | strict | standard | fast |
|------|:------:|:--------:|:----:|
| `gate-enforcement.sh` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `privacy-block.sh` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `project-context-loader.sh` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `post-write.sh` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `pre-ship.sh` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `pre-task-check.sh` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `pre-implement.sh` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `cost-meter.sh` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `post-session.sh` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `learning-observer.sh` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

:::warning Safety-critical hooks never skip
`gate-enforcement.sh` and `privacy-block.sh` are active in **all** profiles, including `fast`. These enforce the two hard gates and sensitive file protection — they cannot be disabled by profile selection.

## Hook configuration

Hooks are registered in `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "sh .claude/hooks/post-write.sh \"$TOOL_INPUT_FILE_PATH\"" }]
      },
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "sh .claude/hooks/learning-observer.sh \"$TOOL_INPUT_FILE_PATH\"" }]
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      { "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "sh .claude/hooks/post-session.sh" }] }
    ]
  }
}
```

## JSON-on-stdin Convention (260408 Migration)

All meowkit hooks now read input as JSON on stdin (per [Claude Code hook docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks)), parsed via the shared shim `lib/read-hook-input.sh`. The shim exports `HOOK_TOOL_NAME`, `HOOK_FILE_PATH`, `HOOK_COMMAND`, `HOOK_SESSION_ID`, `HOOK_EVENT_NAME`, `HOOK_TRANSCRIPT_PATH`, and other fields. Hooks also honor legacy `$1` positional args for back-compat — both forms coexist safely.

Phase 7 of the harness plan migrated all 10 pre-existing hooks and added 4 new middleware hooks to this convention.

## Shared Hook Libraries

Sourceable libraries in `.claude/hooks/lib/` — not hooks themselves:

- `lib/read-hook-input.sh` — JSON-on-stdin parser. Source with `. lib/read-hook-input.sh`; never execute directly. Requires Bash 3.2+. Falls back to system `python3` if venv unavailable. Gracefully degrades (empty vars + warning) if no Python found.
- `lib/secret-scrub.sh` — shared secret redaction. Exports a `scrub_secrets()` function covering Anthropic/OpenAI/AWS/GH/GL/Slack/JWT/PEM patterns. Sourced by hooks that persist content (`conversation-summary-cache.sh`, `append-trace.sh`).

## Middleware Hooks (Phase 7)

### `post-write-build-verify.sh`

Fires on **PostToolUse Edit|Write**. Classifies the written file by extension (`ts/tsx` → `tsc --noEmit|eslint`; `js` → `eslint`; `py` → `ruff check|mypy`; `go` → `go build ./...`; `rs` → `cargo check`; `rb` → `ruby -c|rubocop`). Errors emitted to stdout as `@@BUILD_VERIFY_ERROR@@ … @@END_BUILD_VERIFY@@` blocks (fed back to agent). Results cached by file content hash — unchanged files are skipped. Skips `node_modules/`, `vendor/`, `dist/`, `tasks/`, `docs/`, `.claude/`, test files, and map/lock files.

- **Opt-out:** `MEOWKIT_BUILD_VERIFY=off`
- **Timeout override:** `MEOWKIT_BUILD_VERIFY_TIMEOUT=N` (default 30s for TS; 35s hook registration timeout)
- **Density:** runs in LEAN; skipped in MINIMAL (`MEOWKIT_HARNESS_MODE=MINIMAL`)
- **Source:** `.claude/hooks/post-write-build-verify.sh`

### `post-write-loop-detection.sh`

Fires on **PostToolUse Edit|Write**. Counts per-file edits keyed `{session_id}:{realpath}` in `session-state/edit-counts.json`. Warns at N≥4 (`@@LOOP_DETECT_WARN@@`) and escalates at N≥8 (`@@LOOP_DETECT_ESCALATE@@`) — doom-loop prevention per LangChain harness research. Never blocks; messages are fed back via stdout.

- **Opt-out:** `MEOWKIT_LOOP_DETECT=off`
- **Timeout:** 3s
- **Source:** `.claude/hooks/post-write-loop-detection.sh`

### `pre-completion-check.sh`

Fires on the **Stop** event (not SubagentStop). Hard gate: if no verification evidence exists (no evaluator verdict file, no signed sprint contract, no test-pass markers in the trace log), emits `{"decision":"block","reason":"…"}` JSON to block session close. 3-attempt re-entry guard per active plan slug via `session-state/precompletion-attempts.json`; after 3 attempts soft-nudges and allows stop to prevent infinite loop. LEAN density mode: soft nudge only. MINIMAL: skipped entirely.

- **Opt-out:** `MEOWKIT_PRECOMPLETION=off`
- **Density:** `MEOWKIT_HARNESS_MODE=LEAN` → soft nudge; `MEOWKIT_HARNESS_MODE=MINIMAL` → skip
- **Timeout:** 5s
- **Source:** `.claude/hooks/pre-completion-check.sh`

## Conversation Summary Cache (Phase 9 — Dual-Event)

### `conversation-summary-cache.sh`

Registered under both **Stop** and **UserPromptSubmit**. Branches on `$HOOK_EVENT_NAME`.

**Stop path:** checks throttle conditions (transcript size > `MEOWKIT_SUMMARY_THRESHOLD` AND event delta ≥ `MEOWKIT_SUMMARY_TURN_GAP` OR growth delta ≥ `MEOWKIT_SUMMARY_GROWTH_DELTA`). When conditions are met, spawns a detached `nohup bash worker &` + `disown` (fire-and-forget) that runs `claude -p --model haiku` on the tailed transcript (~60–120s wall time). The hook itself returns in <100ms — the agent is never blocked by Haiku latency. The worker scrubs secrets via `lib/secret-scrub.sh` and atomically writes `.claude/memory/conversation-summary.md`. Lock at `session-state/conversation-summary.lock` prevents overlapping workers (5-minute stale GC).

**UserPromptSubmit path:** reads the cache file, verifies `session_id` match, and emits a `## Prior conversation summary\n{body}\n---\n` block capped at 4KB to stdout (injected into context by Claude Code). Skips on session ID mismatch.

**Throttle defaults:**

| Env var | Default | Semantic |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `MEOWKIT_SUMMARY_THRESHOLD` | `20480` (20KB) | Min transcript size in bytes |
| `MEOWKIT_SUMMARY_TURN_GAP` | `30` | Min JSONL event delta between summaries (≈ 3–6 turns; "TURN_GAP" is a legacy name) |
| `MEOWKIT_SUMMARY_GROWTH_DELTA` | `5120` (5KB) | Min transcript growth in bytes |
| `MEOWKIT_SUMMARY_BUDGET_SEC` | `180` | Background worker hard budget for `claude -p` |

**Consumer chain:** background worker → `.claude/memory/conversation-summary.md` → UserPromptSubmit hook → stdout → Claude Code context injection → every meowkit agent.

**Cost:** ~$0.01–$0.02 per long session. Saves ~48KB/turn of full-transcript re-read.

**User-facing inspector:** `/meow:summary` (see [CLI Commands](/cli/commands)).

**Security:** summary is DATA per `injection-rules.md`. Output is secret-scrubbed before write. Prompt template forbids instruction-shaped content in the summary body.

**Graceful degradation:** if `claude` CLI is missing or summarization fails, the hook exits 0 silently.

- **Opt-out:** `MEOWKIT_SUMMARY_CACHE=off` (disables both Stop and UserPromptSubmit paths)
- **Debug:** `MEOWKIT_SUMMARY_DEBUG=1` — verbose stderr
- **Source:** `.claude/hooks/conversation-summary-cache.sh`
